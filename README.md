## Branch usage

We have many options in the category of used language/framework. If anyone feels interest in making a language port for the project, we could make a branch for that language/framework. In the main repository, please only push documentation, while developing your code, to make it easier to continue development for others.

## My chioce.

I will start a Vue 3 Typescript only-frontend project, which will be deployed to Netlify, or Githup Pages.

#### Advantages
- Runs, and supported on every platform that could run Factorio.
- Hosting is free, and easily accessable.

#### Disadvantages
- Maybe making automatic clipboarding can be a PITA/broken in some cases.
